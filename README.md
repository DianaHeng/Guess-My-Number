# <h1 align="center"> Guess-My-Number </h1>
 <p align="center"> The objective of this project is to create a simple number guessing game. The game will prompt players to guess a number between 1 and 20. For each incorrect guess, the player's score will decrease by 1. The game will provide hints to help the player guess the secret number, such as messages that indicate whether the secret number is higher or lower than the last guess. The project will involve programming the game logic, designing a user-friendly interface, and testing the game to ensure that it functions correctly and provides an enjoyable user experience. </p>
